                        <p>At JJ Herbals, we believe in preserving the purity and potency of Naikurana. Our extraction process is entirely natural, using pure milk to gently extract the active compounds from the herb. This traditional method ensures that the final product is free from any synthetic preservatives or chemicals, maintaining the herb's natural integrity. Each batch of Naikurana is carefully processed to guarantee its freshness and efficacy, with a shelf life of 8 months. This information is based on the user's specific instruction, though standard scientific literature mentions solvent-based extractions; the milk-based process aligns with traditional Ayurvedic practices.</p>
